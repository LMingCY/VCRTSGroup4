\f0\fs24 \cf0 TO DO:\
- Set up a login page for both users and owners.\
	- Login credentials read from spreadsheets and write the spreadsheet (create new user)\
	- First enter a login email (test@gmail.com), then the program loops through the spreadsheet and find 	  the email for login, save its password as a string called \'93correctPassword,\'94 then the program asks 	  the user to input password and save it as a string called \'93inputPassword\'94 and compare.\
- Set up a dashboard for user and owners after login, according to the requirement doc, both are simply text fields to let user/owner input the information. Save the entry as text files name as \'93U_Info_xxxx.txt\'94 (U stands for user, O will be owner, xxxx as the username) each user/owner will have their own separate file (so far is easy to visualize, once the number of users/owners go up may need to think a better idea)\
\
*Use MySQL database for login credentials and other information instead of spreadsheets for easier data manipulation.\
*Make them look nice. (Styling)\
