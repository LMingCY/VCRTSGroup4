!!!!!!!!!FOR FRONTEND!!!!!!!!
>need a PROPER "create account" button for user login page
>Also a "user_account_registration" page that takes in user name, password, name, and email
>need to change the deadline input field into 5 fields as year(4), month(2), day(2), hour(2), minute(2)
>need a better "view_job" and "job_queue" interface as well as "Available_resources" --- just like group 3 (could be merged into one)
>need to specify time format
>(FOR BOTH ENDS) Have ONE login page only, AT MOST two, it doesn't make sense to 3 different login pages.
>a big renovation of all the UI is preferred.

!!!!!!!!!!FOR BACKEND!!!!!!!!!
>connect all the logins to the database.
>remove the hardcoded "LocalDate" variable and actually takes in what users inputted
>start working on the "owner" related classes
>continue to move the backend code (functions & methods) to the backend package and leave a "clean" class for front ends.
>(FOR BOTH ENDS) Have ONE login page only, AT MOST two, it doesn't make sense to have 3 different login pages.

>Fix the parsing error due to me changing the output order of Job attributes
>follow manage_job class and create a similar class called manage vehicles
>add a button to manage_job class that allows admin to remove an already accepted job.
>add a response pop-up for the submitting page so that when the vc accepted the job, on the client side, there should be a pop up saying job accepted!
