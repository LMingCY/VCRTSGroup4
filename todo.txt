TO DO:
- Set up a login page for both users and owners.
	- Login credentials read from spreadsheets and write the spreadsheet (create new frontend.user)\
	- First enter a login email (test@gmail.com), then the program loops through the spreadsheet and find 	  the email for login, save its password as a string called \'93correctPassword,\'94 then the program asks 	  the frontend.user to input password and save it as a string called \'93inputPassword\'94 and compare.\
- Set up a dashboard for frontend.user and owners after login, according to the requirement doc, both are simply text fields to let frontend.user/frontend.owner input the information. Save the entry as text files name as \'93U_Info_xxxx.txt\'94 (U stands for frontend.user, O will be frontend.owner, xxxx as the username) each frontend.user/frontend.owner will have their own separate file (so far is easy to visualize, once the number of users/owners go up may need to think a better idea)\

*Use MySQL database for login credentials and other information instead of spreadsheets for easier data manipulation.\
*Make them look nice. (Styling)

!!Leon: We could drop the credentials for now. (10/8/2024 17:20)
